                  <p>We captured 8 stories about the borough from across Twitter, Facebook, blogs and forums every day.</p>   
                  <p>The results were printed out and staff were able to read them while they ate their lunch. Each story had a bit.ly link to the full version of the story.</p>
                  <p>We were able to determine that no one followed the bit.ly links - this suggests that following links on printed material represents a significant barrier to entry.</p>
                  <p>The project did demonstrate that sufficient data was available, and Kensington &amp; Chelsea suggested we try another instantiation of the work a community centre.</p> 

                  <p>This project relied on the <a href='http://heresay.org.uk'>Heresay</a> platform to find the data.</p>

                  <p>This workshop was an opportunity to test public reaction to hyperlocal news stories. Participants were are asked to organise the fragments of social media into piles while "thinking out loud" about the process.</p>
                  <p>One concern raised from the K&amp;C work was that users would find out of context tweets very confusing, however most people seemed easily able to grasp the decontextualised tweets.</p>

                  <p>The Creative Exchange is spread across three universities. This project looks at ways to keep us all connected, as well as giving us a chance to experience the use of ambient displays first hand.</p>
                  <p>It tracks Twitter, Facebook and Blog updates from the team and displays the most recent information prominently. An audio cue also alerts us to changes. </p>
