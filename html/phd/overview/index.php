            <p>I'm doing a <a href='http://thecreativeexchange.org/'>PhD at RCA</a>. I'm investigating new representations of online social interactions.</p>
            
            <p><a href='/'>[More about me]</a></p>

            <h2 id='hypothesis'>Research Question</h2>
            
            <p>Most communities, for example a village or work place, produce a stream of 'digital exhaust' on services such as:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Facebook &amp; Twitter  &amp; Tumblr</li>
                <li>Forums &amp; Blogs</li>
                <li>Dropbox &amp; Google Docs</li>                
            </ul>
            
            <p>My hypothesis is this data can be aggregated, processed and presented back to the community to assist in collaboration and decision making.</p>
            
            <p>There are three specific areas I will be looking at:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> eg. printed highlights of hyperlocal blogs can reach people who do not read blogs online</li>
                <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> eg. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calm_technology'>Sonification</a> of coworkers Tweets might nudge the team towards knowing more about what each other are thinking about</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> A pattern might emerge from combining Twitter with blog posts that is otherwise invisible</li>                
            </ul>
            
            <p>In my research I will be testing this hypothesis by building prototype systems.</p>    
            
            <h2 id='analogy'>An analogy</h2>
            
            <p>Architects plan offices to increase collaboration, or town planners seek to foster community by structuring public space - is there an equivalent intervention in digital space?</p>
            
            <p>My projects will explore building interfaces that cultivate cohesion in exactly the same way.</p>
            
            
            <h2 id='prototyping'>Prototyping interfaces</h2>
            
            <p>My intention is to carry out rapid, iterative testing of different methods of aggregation, filtering and presentation. In order to achieve this I have built a flexible <a href='https://github.com/jimmytidey/obs'>software platform</a> for aggregation.</p>  

            <p>At the moment I'm developing a series of rapidly deployable ways to present the aggregated data. </p>

            <p>The personal computer screen is the omni-present interface for all digital activities - from organising your calendar to writing to social activity. </p>  
            
            <img src='img/three_activities.png'  alt='Diagram of a single person using a single monitor to do three distinct digital activities' class='center' />
                        
            <p>I'm particularly interested in getting away from this paradigm, instead using a variety of intentionally public or shared interfaces, for example print, projection, shared screens. </p>

            <h2 id='work_so_far'>Work so far</h2>
            
            <h3>Kensington &amp; Chelsea Council</h3>
            <img class='img_border' src="img/little_printer.png" alt="Little Printer printing out receipts">
            
            <img class='img_border' src="img/receipt.png"  alt="Print out of social media activity">
            <p><em>Receipt printer in the K&amp;C council staff canteen.</em></p> 
            <p>We captured 8 stories about the borough from across Twitter, Facebook, blogs and forums every day.</p>   
            <p>The results were printed out and staff were able to read them while they ate their lunch.</p>
            <p>This project relied on the <a href='http://heresay.org.uk'>Heresay</a> platform to find the data.</p>


            <h3>FACT Gallery</h3>
            <img class='img_border' src="img/fact.png" alt="Workshop at FACT gallery">    
            <p><em>Asking cinema goers in the FACT gallery to respond to printed stories from Twitter &amp; Facebook.</em></p>
            <p>This workshop was an opportunity to see public reaction to hyperlocal news stories. Participants were are asked to organise the fragments of social media into piles while "thinking out loud" about the process.</p>
            

            <h3>Wonkbook</h3>
            <img src="img/wonkbook.png" class='img_border'  alt="Wonkbook screen shot">
            <p>Wonkbook was an experiment with Stian Westlake from NESTA. The project started by scraping think tank websites and populating a database of reports and staff </p>
            <p>From there we became interested in finding the Twitter feeds of think tank staff, which gave us a real-time window into the ecosystem.</p>
            <p>We combined this Twitter data with the Twitter feeds of MPs and Journalists to create a league table of a the most retweeted individuals and think tanks.</p>


            <h3>CX Observatory</h3>
            <img src="img/bucket.jpg" class='img_border' alt="Bucket">      
            <p><em>Harvesting the digital exhaust of our office - sonification and screen</em></p>
            <p>The Creative Exchange is spread across three universities. This project looks at ways to keep us all connected, as well as giving us a chance to experience the use of ambient displays first hand.</p>
            <p>It tracks Twitter, Facebook and Blog updates from the team and displays the most recent information prominently. An audio cue also alerts us to changes. </p>
            <p>I plan to encompass Dropbox and Google Docs activity soon.</p>
