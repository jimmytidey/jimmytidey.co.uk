	<p>I'm Jimmy, I'm in my final year of a PhD at The Royal College of Art.</p> 

      <p>Before RCA I worked in tech, and before that I did a degree in physics &amp; philosophy. Favourite gigs include: <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/labuk/'>citizen science at the BBC</a>, integrating <a href='http://www.monterosa.co.uk/'>online games into live TV</a>, creative developer at an <a href='https://evrythng.com/'>IoT startup</a>.</p>
      
      <p>In my research I'm bringing my experience of delivering digital products together with theoretical approaches from network science, economics and policy - building digital tools for new kinds of collaboration and coordination.</p>
      
      <p>My focus is using social media to make public policy more responsive and inclusive.  Brands monitor social media to understand what customers say about their products, could the public sector be as nimble?</p>

      <p>I have developed <a href='http://localnets.org/'>Localnets.org</a> - a tool which helps local government find out what a community is saying on Twitter. It's been used in research with <a href='http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/community-mirror-data-driven-method-below-radar-research'>NESTA</a> and <a href='https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/reports/community-capital-the-value-of-connected-communities/'>The RSA</a>, and is being piloted at NHS Birmingham.</p> 

      <p>My blog records the various <a href='http://jimmytidey.co.uk/blog/category/hack-days/'>hackdays</a>, <a href='http://jimmytidey.co.uk/blog/category/conferences/'>conferences</a>, &amp; <a href='http://jimmytidey.co.uk/blog/lote4-the-stewardship-matera/'>uncategorisable happenings</a> that I've organised or participated in.</p>  
      
      <h3>Selected projects</h3>

      <p>LocalNets is a Twitter Analytics tool aimed at Local Government and other non-market institutions. I developed LocalNets in the course of my PhD, and it supported all of my field work.</p>

      <p>It is based on Mongo, Node &amp; Neo4J, and has been used with NHS Birmingham, the RSA, DemSoc, NESTA, DCLG and in numerous other projects.</p>
