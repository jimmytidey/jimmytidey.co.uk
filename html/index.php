            	<p>I'm Jimmy, I'm awaiting my viva for my PhD at The Royal College of Art. My research concerned building and testing a Twitter analytics platform designed for use by local government institutions as a case study in civic uses social media analytics.</p>

                  <p>Before starting my PhD I worked on digital products as a developer and a product manager. My undergrad degree is in physics &amp; philosophy.</p> 
                  
                  <p>My research brings together my experience of developing digital products with theoretical approaches from network science, economics, public policy and design research.</p>
