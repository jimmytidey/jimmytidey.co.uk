			<p>I'm Jimmy, I'm in my final year of a PhD at The Royal College of Art.</p> 

      <p>Before RCA I worked in tech. Favourite gigs include: <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/labuk/'>citizen science at the BBC</a>, integrating <a href='http://www.monterosa.co.uk/'>online games into live TV</a>, creative developer at an <a href='https://evrythng.com/'>IoT startup</a>.</p>
      
      <p>My PhD is about using social media to make pubic policy more responsive and inclusive. 
        
      <p>Companies like AirBnB &amp; Zipcar are incredibly successful at matching fragmentary capacity &amp; needs. Could we design something similar to help the public sector be as nimble?</p>

      <p>I've developed <a href='https://localnets.org'>Localnets.org</a> - a tool which helps find the capacities and needs citizens express on Twitter. It's been used in research with NESTA and The RSA, and is being piloted at NHS Birmingham.</p> 

      <p>From a theoretical perspective, I'm drawing on economics, network science &amp; sociology to think about designing new ways of collaborating, sharing &amp; coordinating.</p> 
      
      <p>My blog records the various <a href=''>hackdays</a>, <a href=''>conferences</a>, &amp; <a href=''>uncategorisable happenings</a> that I've organised or participated in. I'm especially interested in collaborations that cross boundaries between the sciences &amp; humanities (or however you want to construe that divide).</p>
