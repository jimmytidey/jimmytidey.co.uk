            	<p>I'm Jimmy, I'm awaiting my viva for my PhD at The Royal College of Art. In my PhD research I built a Twitter analytics platform for local government, which became a case study for civic social media analytics.</p> 

                  <p>Before starting my PhD I worked on digital products as a developer and a product manager. My undergrad degree is in physics &amp; philosophy.</p> 
                  
                  <p>My research bringings together my experience of developing digital products with theoretical approaches from network science, economics and public policy.</p>

                        <p>It uses Mongo, Node &amp; Neo4J, and has been piloted with NHS Birmingham South Central Clinical Commissioning Group, <a href='#rsa'>the RSA, NESTA, the Department for Communities and Local Goverment</a>, DemSoc,the <a href='https://gateway-project.org.uk/'>Greenwich Driverless autonomous vehical trial</a> and in numerous other projects.</p>

                        <p><a href='https://whotargets.me/'>Who Targets Me</a> is a browser extension that collects data about the political adverts people see on Facebook. It was developed in the run up to the 2017 general election to combat 'dark adverts'. It had over 20,000 downloads before the election.</p> 

                        <p> It was supported by <a href='https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/'>The Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a> and The Guardian.</p>

                        <p>Developed to answer a personal need, nearly 300 other academics have used the tool.</p>
