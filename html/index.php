			<p>I'm Jimmy. I'm doing a PhD at The Royal College of Art. My research question is: How can tech can help us cooperate, share and collaborate? In other words, what new kinds of '<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action'>social coordination</a>' are emerging?</p> 
      
      <p>Are 'sharing economy' platforms or civic innovations like Fix My Street ethical? Could we design them to be more effective? Using ideas from economics, network science and design I'm researching digital platforms for social coordination.</p>   
        
      <p>It's not all ivory tower, I've developed <a href='https://localnets.org'>Localnets.org</a> - which helps local government understand what citizens are saying on Twitter, currently in use with NHS Birmingham.</p> 
      
      <p>My background is project management and programming. I've worked on citizen science at the BBC, integrating online games with Live TV, and at an IoT startup.</p>
      
      <p>My blog records the various hackdays, conferences, and uncategorisable happenings that I've organised or participated in. I'm especially interested in collaborations that cross boundaries between sciences and humanities (or however you want to construe that divide).</p>
